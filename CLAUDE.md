Atlassian JIRA and Confluence API documentation is available in the file './atlassian_api_docs.txt'

Use github cli tools to read the description of the pull requests that are not in the main branch of upstream with the pull requests that WERE merged into this repo.

If the PR is finished/complete and the description indicates so, or at least does not claim to be a work in progress, ensure the PR's functionality is integrated and tested.
